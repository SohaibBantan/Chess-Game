Welcome to the Chess Project! This project involves working with 2D arrays and inheritance concepts to build a chess game.

📜 Overview
This project simulates a chess game using object-oriented programming principles. It includes the core functionalities of chess, such as player moves, piece movements, and basic chess rules.

🛠️ Features
2D Array-based Chess Board: Represents the chessboard using a 2D array for piece placement.
Inheritance: Uses inheritance to define different chess pieces and their movements.
Move Validation: Implements checks for legal moves for each piece.
Basic Game Rules: Includes rules like check and checkmate detection. (In the form of capturing the King)

🏁 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later

Clone the repository to your local machine:


-Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-project.git
cd chess-project

Compile the project:

- Copy code
javac *.java

Run the main class:

Copy code
java Main

📂 Project Structure
Main.java: The entry point of the application.

Board.java: Handles the chessboard and piece placement.

Piece.java: The base class for all chess pieces.

King.java, Queen.java, etc.: Subclasses that define specific chess pieces and their movements.

🚀 Usage
Start the program using the steps above.
Follow the prompts to make moves as a player.

Enter chess moves using the following order. Row of piece, column of piece, end row destination, end column destination.

📝 Notes
This project implements basic chess logic but does not cover all complex rules of chess.
Future improvements may include additional rules, a GUI, and enhanced AI.
